## 2026-04-19 — Prompt folding order: style → brand → character → base

**Context.** When multiple consistency nodes apply, what order do they appear in the
folded prompt?

**Decision.** `foldConsistencyIntoPrompt` emits fragments in the order `[style] [brand]
[character] + base prompt`. Negative prompts are merged separately (comma-joined) and
returned to the caller; LoRA pins and reference asset ids are surfaced as separate
structured fields (they're provider-specific hooks, not prompt text).

**Why this ordering.** Diffusion models weight the tail of the prompt more heavily
(well-known inference-time behavior). The base prompt is the most specific signal
("what does this shot look like"), so it goes last. Identity (character) sits right
before it so the model enters the shot-specific portion already thinking about the
subject. Global look (style, brand) goes first because it sets the scene before
identity and content arrive.
