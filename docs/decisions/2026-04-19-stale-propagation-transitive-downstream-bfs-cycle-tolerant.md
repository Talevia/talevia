## 2026-04-19 — Stale propagation: transitive downstream BFS, cycle-tolerant

**Context.** "Change traveling downstream through the DAG" is the primitive the rest of
the system needs. It has to be cheap to call per mutation (mutations happen on every
tool run) and robust to malformed graphs.

**Decision.** `Source.stale(changed: Set<SourceNodeId>)` returns the transitive closure
over the reverse-parent edges, including the seeds. Uses a BFS with a visited set, so
cycles don't hang. Unknown ids in `changed` are silently dropped from the seed set
rather than throwing — callers pass in "things I think changed" and get back "things
that are actually stale in the current graph."

**Alternatives considered.**
- **Reject cycles at the data layer.** Rejected: cycles are a *semantic* error, not a
  data-shape error. The loader can stay tolerant; a separate linter can surface cycles
  when a genre schema knows they're invalid.
- **Cache the child index on `Source`.** Rejected for v1: `Source` is an immutable
  value; callers that need the index across many `stale()` calls can hoist
  `Source.childIndex` themselves. Premature caching would complicate equality.
