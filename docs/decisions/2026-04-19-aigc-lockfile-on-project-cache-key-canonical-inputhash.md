## 2026-04-19 — AIGC lockfile on Project, cache key = canonical inputHash

**Context.** VISION §3.1 calls for "产物可 pin": key AIGC artifacts should be fixable so
a second call with identical inputs reuses the same output rather than re-抽卡. We need
a place to store the pin + a cache-lookup key shape.

**Decision.**
- `Project.lockfile: Lockfile` stores an ordered list of `LockfileEntry(inputHash,
  toolId, assetId, provenance, sourceBinding)`. Default empty; pre-lockfile projects
  decode cleanly.
- `inputHash` is `fnv1a64Hex` over a canonical `key=value|key=value…` string the tool
  builds from its full input surface (tool id, model + version, seed, dimensions,
  effective prompt after consistency fold, applied binding ids). Any field that can
  change the output goes into the hash.
- `AigcPipeline` (stateless object) exposes `ensureSeed`, `foldPrompt`, `inputHash`,
  `findCached`, `record`. Every AIGC tool consumes these — no inheritance.
- Lookup semantics: `findCached` returns the *last* matching entry, so a regenerate
  with identical inputs later in the project supersedes earlier matches for audit
  ordering but yields the same asset id.

**Alternatives considered.**
- **Composition-based `AigcPipeline` helper vs abstract `AigcToolBase` class.**
  Picked helpers: Kotlin inheritance for tools with different I/O shapes forces
  covariance tricks and "call super" discipline. Plain functions compose.
- **Content-addressed asset blobs (store keyed by file-hash).** Rejected for v1: the
  artifact layer already persists blobs through `MediaBlobWriter`; reusing an
  existing asset id by lockfile is enough. Content-addressing becomes interesting
  when we move to a **shared remote cache** — at that point swap `fnv1a64Hex`
  → SHA-256 and promote the lockfile to the content-hash'd layer.
- **Separate table for the lockfile (not on Project).** Rejected: the lockfile is
  per-project state, naturally travels with the `Project` serialized JSON blob in
  SqlDelight; separating it would add a second source of truth for the same project.

**Seed + caching interaction.** Cache hits are meaningful only when the seed is stable.
If the caller omits `seed`, `AigcPipeline.ensureSeed` mints one client-side and the
entry is recorded with that seed — a later call with `seed=null` mints a *different*
seed, producing a miss. The agent coach prompt (Task 5) should nudge toward explicit
seeds when the user wants determinism.
